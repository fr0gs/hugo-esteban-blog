<h1 id="travel">Travel</h1>
<p>I don't really count <strong>Belgium</strong> since this is my third year living here, and 2018 will start as my fourth year outside my beloved <strong>Spain</strong>.</p>
<p>I have been to quite some nice places though. Some of them I had already been there, some of them were new, bust mostly I prioritized people over places themselves. Almost every new city or country I went to was due to the interest of catching up with old friends or traveling together for a long weekend. Theres is however one long trip exception. I don't have the places noted down so I'll try to draw them directly from memory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Germany</strong>: Berlin.</li>
<li><strong>The Netherlands</strong>: Amsterdam, Den Haag, Maastricht, Rotterdam.</li>
<li><strong>Spain</strong>: Barcelona, Madrid.</li>
<li><strong>United Kingdom</strong>: London.</li>
<li><strong>Norway</strong>: Bergen.</li>
<li><strong>France</strong>: Paris, Reunion Island.</li>
<li><strong>Bulgaria</strong>: Sunny Beach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the places I went to were due to friends living there, visiting over, or just an excuse to make a small trip. <em>Reunion Island</em> was the best trip I have ever done in my life. The island is a <em>DÃ©partement d'Outre Mer</em> belonging to France, a small island in the Indic Ocean, next to <strong>Madagascar</strong> and <strong>Mauritius</strong>, is a paradise on earth, a territory full of incredible mountains, beautiful views, amazing food and unbelievably welcoming people.</p>
<p>A hodgepodge of cultures, religions and origins. A hidden oasis for those who seek for an inner voyage.</p>

<p>Best. Place. Ever.</p>
<h1 id="work--technologies">Work &amp; Technologies</h1>
<p>The year started quite strong, I had moved in October to the <strong>Semantic Technology</strong> branch of my company at the last part of year 2016 and I had to learn quite fast all the new technologies and stacks that were used in my new team. I won't make an exhaustive list, just some things were I feel I have sensibly improved.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Javascript &amp; Ember.js</strong>: I still kept strengthening my position as the javascript fan of the company, but as new challenges kept coming, I had to quickly adapt to new scenarios and projects si I had to put those skills a little aside.</li>
<li><strong>Python</strong>: I developed &amp; maintained several microservices in this language, so I needed to brush up on the it and its particularities. I enjoyed <strong>a lot</strong> working with async/await, list comprehensions, lambda functions and OOP back again. I am lucky I have a <em>very</em> patient mentor, my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/CecileTonglet">@cecton</a>, a pouring fountain of python know-how.</li>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: I had to learn, fight and dive into docker containers, images, volumes, docker networking and docker-compose applications, suffering several quirks, since the majority of the projects were developed in this manner.</li>
<li><strong>Linux Makefiles</strong>: This was equally annoying and fun. I had to extend a data transformation pipeline using a Makefile, so I needed to deal for several weeks with it, it was very nice when I discovered that you can define functions inside Makefiles to avoid repeating code for very similar build targets!</li>
<li><strong>SPARQL</strong>: Since I work in a Linked Data oriented team, we store data in triplestores accessed with the SPARQL query language, so I needed to learn the basics.</li>
<li><strong>Elasticsearch &amp; Kibana</strong>: I became familiar with Elasticsearch &amp; Kibana due to a new project that came up and I was the available developer by then. It proved a lucky strike since I had a lot of fun learning them and they are widely used in the industry.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="general-learning">General Learning</h1>
<ul>
<li>I had a double improvement: I improved both my presentational skills and my <strong>English</strong> as the result of doing small presentations and exposing my work to colleagues.</li>
<li>I have written quite some blog posts and therefore my technical communication skills feel cleaner.</li>
<li>I practiced some <strong>Dutch</strong> for fun and before I realized I was able to maintain simple but complete conversations while doing my daily tasks.</li>
<li>I learned how to sew very very basicly.</li>
<li>I managed to cook some cool dishes when cooking for friends!

<h1 id="sports">Sports</h1>
<p>I have not done as much sport this year as I would've liked but I've had my fair share of fun.</p>
<ul>
<li>Running: on the beach, in the woods, anywhere.</li>
<li>Trampoline park: they opened one in my hometown and had to test it.</li>
<li>Gymnastics: this was tough.</li>
<li>Climbing: a colleague and I have tested multiple boulder and climbing walls around.</li>
<li>Swimming.</li>
<li>Crossfit: a single day, very physically taxing, I would think twice before repeating.</li>
<li>Working out at the gym: as always, just to stay as fit as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="new-year-2018-resolutions">New Year 2018 Resolutions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Reading at least 3 technical books.</li>
<li>Starting to learn a new language: this is very tricky, since I genuinely enjoy languages and choosing a new one is hard. I want a very complicated one that forces my mind to twist, so I was thinking between <strong>chinese</strong>, <strong>arabic</strong>, <strong>russian</strong> or <strong>german</strong>.</li>
<li>Giving a talk at a conference/meetup: the worst part of this is going to be deciding about the topic..</li>
<li>Travel to another continent. Hell, I have never left Europe yet!</li>
<li>Learn a new programming language/paradigm. I am thinking in Rust or Clojure.</li>
<li>Create a stock market portfolio and perform my first investment.</li>
<li>Be able to perform three consecutive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle-up">muscle-up</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. I think I will be able to do all of them.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
