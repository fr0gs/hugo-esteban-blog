<h1 id="things-ive-done--learnt-so-far">Things I've done &amp; learnt so far</h1>
<ul>
<li>I got my A2 motorbike permit :D</li>
<li>I learnt to make a couple new recipes with toasts.</li>
<li>I finally threw in the beach a couple Chinese lanterns with a friend in our hometown holiday, we used to forget every year!</li>
<li>I completed the <a href="https://www.padi.com/es/cursos/open-water-diver">PADI Open Water Diver Course</a>, it is the first begginer's certification in scuba diving. There are some others worldwide recognized as SSI. It was also the first time I did scuba diving and I loved it.</li>
<li>I tried Surf for the first time but it was not the most pleasant experience. I have been snowboarding for years and thought I could transfer some knowledge but they turn to be two quite different worlds.</li>
<li>I have done Yoga for the first time. I really enjoyed it!</li>
<li>I learnt how to say &ldquo;Rock, Paper, Scissors&rdquo; in Chinese and I am quite proud of it.</li>
<li>I learnt how Singapore went for a fisherman's village to the technological &amp; economical hub it is today.</li>
<li>I learnt about the arrival of Islam to Malaysia.</li>
<li>I learnt about the history of Bali and it's colonization past with the Dutch.</li>
<li>I started a small programming project involving MindMaps, but don't really devote much time to it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="things-i-would-like-to-do">Things I would like to do</h1>
<p>I think it is better to keep this to myself, there are so many things that I am afraid that if I share all them and don't do at least the majority, I come out as a failure. Better this way.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This months have given me quite a good perspective about life, myself and traveling. I've come to realize that success means different things to different people and that traveling as a means to achieve some kind of inner peace is often irrevelant, as that peace must come from whithin. I am definitely still working on that.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
