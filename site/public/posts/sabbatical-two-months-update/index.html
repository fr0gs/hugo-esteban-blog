<p>Hello! It has been a long time since I last updated. I left my job and Belgium two months ago at the end of February to give myself some perspective and travel a bit.</p>
<p>I've kept myself busy ever since. I wanted to create a small update to gather all the things that have attracted my interest since I stopped my daily job. Additionally, I find useful to enumerate some of the things I have in my backlog and I hope to tackle as soon as I have time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have been quite disconnected to technical writing and messing around with software projects, but I will try to go back as soon as I can.</p>
<h1 id="things-ive-done">Things I've done</h1>
<ul>
<li>I fixed my bike at home.</li>
<li>I started with the A2 motorcycle permit, and passed already the first test.</li>
<li>I started learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_picking">lockpicking</a> and I managed to open two locks so far!</li>
<li>I wrote a quick &amp; dirty scraper in python to automate some downloads.</li>
<li>I started learning arabic with <a href="https://app.mondly.com/home">Mondly</a>, but I have stopped with it for now.</li>
<li>I have started reading an investment book to learn the basics.</li>
<li>I learnt <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> and I created &amp; sketched what is going to be my alternate site, mostly oriented towards travel articles and reflections: <a href="https://thedrift.io">https://thedrift.io</a>. I will try to reflect my musings and experiences over this sabbatical time there.</li>
<li>I booked a flight to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a>. I will start my trip from there.</li>
<li>I did a job coaching online course to try to figure out my next steps.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="things-i-want-to-do">Things I want to do</h1>
<ul>
<li>I want to become proficient in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, but this looks like a lifelong task.</li>
<li>I want to dive deep in a functional language. I keep doubting between <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">Common Lisp</a> and <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>.</li>
<li>I want to learn more about <a href="http://webassembly.org/">Web Assembly</a>.</li>
<li>I want to learn more about the blockchain.</li>
<li>I want to do some challenges in <a href="https://hackattic.com/challenges">Hackattic</a>.</li>
<li>And of course, keep up with the things I have already started with.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is it, hopefully when I start traveling I will be more prolific with my articles.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
