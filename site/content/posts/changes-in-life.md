I can't start this article lamenting my recent lack of posts because of [this](/posts/on-freedom/) [two](/posts/adding-funny-quotes-tmux-statusbar/) outliers I put out in the wild recently. But for the sake of theatricals, Oh it's been ages since I wrote content!

There were a lof of changes in my life during last year. Around 8 months ago I had been working for a startup making management software for healthcare practitioners and despite everything was going fine both professionally and personally, I was at unease, feeling a gap I couldn't find the exact piece to fill with. The job was challenging and the tech stack was interesting, my colleagues were kind, easygoing and encouraging, and I was in front of the office from my home in under 15 minutes.

Still, there was something missing, a misplaced cog that is making the full system squeak. Of course there are ups and downs throughout the year. The absence of sun during the cold months, poor diet, lack of exercise.. any could be the culprit so I didn't give it much importance. Better sleeping schedule, doing sports more often and paying extra attention to what I put in my belly will do the trick.

Several months went by and concentration started to be a precarious asset. After some rumination I exposed the problem to my CEO, and had the best of reactions. He was understanding and supportive. He knew how to downplay the importance of a sudden drop in productivity and highlighted the principal value of being first happy and then results will follow. The meeting made an impact in me, spurred the decision to clear my thoughts and identify the root cause of my discontent.

Two additional months in, the void was still present. Motivation and energy were running low and I was tired of not figuring out what was missing. I noticed I had noticeably dropped my interest in development and tech in general. I never considered myself a hardcore geek, more of an "interested mild" one. I no longer checked new github repos, followed blogs or coded a bit on my free time. After work I was exhausted and before I just didn't feel like it.

Could it be possible I had depleted my interest in tech? The idea of staring at a screen 40h/week was disheartening. I was quite new in tech, having worked only for 3 years. I [looked](https://lobste.rs/s/sm09uz/how_did_you_find_meaningful_work) [for](https://lobste.rs/s/orbiuh/ask_is_your_work_meaningful) [several](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15480233) [sources](https://medium.com/@melissamcewen/i-just-dont-want-to-be-a-software-developer-anymore-a371422069a1) to shed some light to the issue but at the end I felt a *change* was needed.
