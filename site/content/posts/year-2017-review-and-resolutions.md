Every time a new year passes by I feel a mix of two reactions: on one side, my first impression is always of a slight disappointment, as if I had not accomplished anything worth mentioning or hadn't made much more of a change compared to how I was when the year first started.

Then, I try to keep a cold mind and start enumerating the nice, interesting things I have done and learned, as well as all the new friendships made and the strengthening of existing ones, and slowly I tear down the thin depression web I made myself lay upon me.



# Travel

I don't really count **Belgium** since this is my third year living here, and 2018 will start as my fourth year outside my beloved **Spain**.

I have been to quite some nice places though. Some of them I had already been there, some of them were new, bust mostly I prioritized people over places themselves. Almost every new city or country I went to was due to the interest of catching up with old friends or traveling together for a long weekend. Theres is however one long trip exception. I don't have the places noted down so I'll try to draw them directly from memory.

* **Germany**: Berlin.
* **The Netherlands**: Amsterdam, Den Haag, Maastricht, Rotterdam.
* **Spain**: Barcelona, Madrid.
* **United Kingdom**: London.
* **Norway**: Bergen.
* **France**: Paris, Reunion Island.
* **Bulgaria**: Sunny Beach.

Most of the places I went to were due to friends living there, visiting over, or just an excuse to make a small trip. *Reunion Island* was the best trip I have ever done in my life. The island is a *DÃ©partement d'Outre Mer* belonging to France, a small island in the Indic Ocean, next to **Madagascar** and **Mauritius**, is a paradise on earth, a territory full of incredible mountains, beautiful views, amazing food and unbelievably welcoming people.

A hodgepodge of cultures, religions and origins. A hidden oasis for those who seek for an inner voyage.

Best. Place. Ever.


# Work & Technologies

The year started quite strong, I had moved in October to the **Semantic Technology** branch of my company at the last part of year 2016 and I had to learn quite fast all the new technologies and stacks that were used in my new team. I won't make an exhaustive list, just some things were I feel I have sensibly improved.

* **Javascript & Ember.js**: I still kept strengthening my position as the javascript fan of the company, but as new challenges kept coming, I had to quickly adapt to new scenarios and projects si I had to put those skills a little aside.
* **Python**: I developed & maintained several microservices in this language, so I needed to brush up on the it and its particularities. I enjoyed **a lot** working with async/await, list comprehensions, lambda functions and OOP back again. I am lucky I have a *very* patient mentor, my colleague [@cecton](https://twitter.com/CecileTonglet), a pouring fountain of python know-how.
* **Docker**: I had to learn, fight and dive into docker containers, images, volumes, docker networking and docker-compose applications, suffering several quirks, since the majority of the projects were developed in this manner.
* **Linux Makefiles**: This was equally annoying and fun. I had to extend a data transformation pipeline using a Makefile, so I needed to deal for several weeks with it, it was very nice when I discovered that you can define functions inside Makefiles to avoid repeating code for very similar build targets!
* **SPARQL**: Since I work in a Linked Data oriented team, we store data in triplestores accessed with the SPARQL query language, so I needed to learn the basics.
* **Elasticsearch & Kibana**: I became familiar with Elasticsearch & Kibana due to a new project that came up and I was the available developer by then. It proved a lucky strike since I had a lot of fun learning them and they are widely used in the industry.





# General Learning

* I had a double improvement: I improved both my presentational skills and my **English** as the result of doing small presentations and exposing my work to colleagues.
* I have written quite some blog posts and therefore my technical communication skills feel cleaner.
* I practiced some **Dutch** for fun and before I realized I was able to maintain simple but complete conversations while doing my daily tasks.
* I learned how to sew very very basicly.
* I managed to cook some cool dishes when cooking for friends!

# Sports

I have not done as much sport this year as I would've liked but I've had my fair share of fun.

* Running: on the beach, in the woods, anywhere.
* Trampoline park: they opened one in my hometown and had to test it.
* Gymnastics: this was tough.
* Climbing: a colleague and I have tested multiple boulder and climbing walls around.
* Swimming.
* Crossfit: a single day, very physically taxing, I would think twice before repeating.
* Working out at the gym: as always, just to stay as fit as possible.

# New Year 2018 Resolutions

* Reading at least 3 technical books.
* Starting to learn a new language: this is very tricky, since I genuinely enjoy languages and choosing a new one is hard. I want a very complicated one that forces my mind to twist, so I was thinking between **chinese**, **arabic**, **russian** or **german**.
* Giving a talk at a conference/meetup: the worst part of this is going to be deciding about the topic..
* Travel to another continent. Hell, I have never left Europe yet!
* Learn a new programming language/paradigm. I am thinking in Rust or Clojure.
* Create a stock market portfolio and perform my first investment.
* Be able to perform three consecutive [muscle-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle-up).


That's it. I think I will be able to do all of them.


Have fun!
