# Overview

Hello! It has been a long time since I last updated. I left my job and Belgium two months ago at the end of February to give myself some perspective and travel a bit.

I've kept myself busy ever since. I wanted to create a small update to gather all the things that have attracted my interest since I stopped my daily job. Additionally, I find useful to enumerate some of the things I have in my backlog and I hope to tackle as soon as I have time.

Unfortunately I have been quite disconnected to technical writing and messing around with software projects, but I will try to go back as soon as I can.

# Things I've done

* I fixed my bike at home.
* I started with the A2 motorcycle permit, and passed already the first test.
* I started learning [lockpicking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_picking) and I managed to open two locks so far!
* I wrote a quick & dirty scraper in python to automate some downloads.
* I started learning arabic with [Mondly](https://app.mondly.com/home), but I have stopped with it for now.
* I have started reading an investment book to learn the basics.
* I learnt [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) and I created & sketched what is going to be my alternate site, mostly oriented towards travel articles and reflections: [https://thedrift.io](https://thedrift.io). I will try to reflect my musings and experiences over this sabbatical time there.
* I booked a flight to [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore). I will start my trip from there.
* I did a job coaching online course to try to figure out my next steps.


# Things I want to do

* I want to become proficient in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), but this looks like a lifelong task.
* I want to dive deep in a functional language. I keep doubting between [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/) and [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).
* I want to learn more about [Web Assembly](http://webassembly.org/).
* I want to learn more about the blockchain.
* I want to do some challenges in [Hackattic](https://hackattic.com/challenges).
* And of course, keep up with the things I have already started with.


This is it, hopefully when I start traveling I will be more prolific with my articles.


Have fun!
