Here you can find some of the projects I've done either by myself or while working for my employer but are open source, that might be considered interesting. Some were fun, some not, but at least I learn with all of them.

* [DCAT-AP Catalog](https://github.com/tenforce/dcat-ap-editor) (2017): DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web. I developed an application to browse & edit **Catalogs**, **Datasets** and **Distributions** using and tweaking the [mu-semtech](https://mu.semte.ch/) microservices stack.

* [Data Vlaanderen](http://data.vlaanderen.be/) (2017): This project is an effort of the [Flamish Information Angecy](http://www.vlaanderen.be/informatievlaanderen) to publish internal data in a linked data format to be consumed.

* [Big Data Europe project](https://www.big-data-europe.eu/about/) (2016-2017):Big Data Europe stands as a project result of the joint effort of several european organizations and companies to provide an architecture to incorporate Big Data techniques and workflows into their existing processes and infrastructure. In this framework, I have developed & contributed in several microservices, along with developing UI integration for all of them.

    * **app-http-logger**: provide out-of-the-box automatic logging of your running docker containers, and make the data available on *ElasticSearch* & *Kibana* for further analysis and visualization. It was developed for the [Big Data Europe](http://www.big-data-europe.eu/) project. Code is available [here](https://github.com/big-data-europe/app-http-logger).
    
    * **mu-docker-compose-handler**: microservice to download the docker-compose.yml from a given repository's URL and store it in a graph database. Code is available [here](https://github.com/big-data-europe/mu-docker-compose-handler)
    
    * **mu-docker-stats**: microservice to fetch statistics data from a triplestore database about running docker containers for frontend consumption. Code is available [here](https://github.com/fr0gs/mu-docker-stats)

* [ESCO](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/home) (2016): ESCO is the multilingual classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations. ESCO is part of the Europe 2020 strategy. We have the permission of the European Commission to open source our code, so I worked a great deal on this project. All repo code can be found [here](https://github.com/tenforce). 

* **phaser-typescript-portfolio**: I wanted to write an interactive portfolio like the one from [Daniel Sternlicht](http://danielsternlicht.com/), also featured [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/develop-a-one-of-a-kind-cssjs-based-game-portfolio/), so I wrote a very simple one-level RPG like using the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) game library and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Code is available [here](https://github.com/fr0gs/phaser-typescript-portfolio).

* [Oferteos](http://oferteos.es) (2017): Oferteos is a simple bargain aggregator site for spanish customers where you can browse through multiple offers coming from several different online shops. 


All the code I write is available in my [github repository](https://github.com/fr0gs/).
